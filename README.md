## PARITY-MAC - helps your windows machine feel familiar like a mac

I have compiled my keymappings to make sense on windows so that many common (not all) mac keyboard shortcuts work on windows so that I can share an apple magic keyboard between windows 10 and macOS.

Here are the results.. enjoy!

First Install Sharp Keys (google it) and use the configuration below..

Now install Autohotkey and start the MacKeyboard.ahk file in this repository on startup (google it)

Done!

Enjoy some sanity on your windows 10 machine :)
